download and install the android application on your android phone and point it at the marker included above to check out a basic functional version of the application. 
The application is still under development an currently the application data transfer occurs using Mqtt protocol. 
The OPC communication is functional in the unity editor but is still yet to be made available in the android application.
The object detection feature is also under development and right now is trained to detect common objects which in the next version will be customised to detect specific objects.
